- Sales rep target: 1 building/week
- 90% automated ops goal
- Redesign coordination layer, don't layer logistics optimization

### Open Questions

Generic startup advice, high-level theory without execution, overcomplicated stacks, marketplace models relying on subsidies, growth that sacrifices unit economics, ignoring provided data, repetitive explanations, em dashes, fluff
